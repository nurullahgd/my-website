    "description": "Hello! I am Nurullah Gündoğdu. I am a Backend Developer focused on the power behind the scenes—the invisible engine that drives digital products. For me, software is more than just working code; it's about architecting systems that remain secure, scalable, and performant even under high traffic. Leveraging the Golang ecosystem and modern cloud technologies (Docker, Kubernetes), I transform complex data flows into manageable and sustainable infrastructures. Building robust foundations in the digital world is my engineering discipline.",
